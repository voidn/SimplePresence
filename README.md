# SimplePresence, NyaPresence
A few QOL changes to SimplePresence. [Original here](https://github.com/justdotJS/SimplePresence/wiki/)

-- Automatically launch from autoRun.sh without needing to use the console, and piping elsewhere to mimimize window presence.

-- Automatically cycle presence data based on arrays to remove the need for user input to change status information.
  -- Pair presence state with descriptor for more interesting/meaningful status.
